  Why start a blog?
---

Hello ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my homepage.

I've always wanted a blog of my own that I could consider as my home on the internet. After quite some time, it finally came to realization after I graduated from college and found myself with lots of free time. 

This blog was created with simplicity in mind and its appearance may change in the future. I chose to create a blog instead of posting on social media because I wanted something more *personalized*, and because I'm not an active social media user (I just opened my Instagram account this year, 2023).

This website will contain topics that interest me and that I think over. As a Mathematics graduate, you will see many posts in this blog from my college notes while I was studying in Bandung. In addition to Mathematics, other topics that capture my interest are programming and technology in general. I'm not an expert in these two fields, so please spare me for my mediocrity.

If you check this post a few days after it is published,
you will notice that the blog doesn't yet have a comment section. Do not worry, comment sections will be added to future posts. Please feel free to contact me via email or on any social media platform (I mean Instagram, the only one I have). I'm happy to engage in conversation with you.

Thank you for visiting, see you again soon. ðŸ˜Š
